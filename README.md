Electrophorus
=============

Electrophorus is the place to start, if you want to shock someone with the speed, quality and reusability 
of your bioinformatics programs. This is a collection of some of the best modules released under MIT/BSD
type license (no copy-left ones) available online. We added or are in the process of adding a few missing 
blocks here and there and released all of them under MIT license.

All codes are written in C, as we usually try to stay away from C++. Therefore, we are in the process of
readopt some of the available modules.


1. Klib by Heng Li (attractivechaos)
------------------------------------

https://github.com/attractivechaos/klib


This module provides a number of C routines for speedy processing of nucleotide data. It also includes a number of
useful data structures. The README file at the above link explains how to use them in the code.

		lookup3

		MurmurHash



	ii) Bloom filter


	iii) KM-sketch


	iv) Perfect hash



3. HPClib 
------------------------------------

	i) pthreads code
